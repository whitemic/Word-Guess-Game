# Word-Guess-Game

Project Description: 
    An NFL-themed hangman game. You begin the game by pressing any letter key that you wish to guess. If that guess is part of the word, then the letter or number will show up in place of an empty space or spaces in the displayed area. Otherwise, that letter or number will show up next to the "letters guessed" portion of the screen. Each word chosen for the individual games will be a lowercase representation of the name of an NFL team. For example, if the New England Patriots is the team that is chosen, the word you would need to guess would be "patriots." Once the word has been correctly guessed, the logo of that team will appear in the box next to the game box and a new word will be chosen. If the guesses run out before the game has been won, "You lost!" will be displayed in that box instead and the name of the correct team will appear on the screen for three seconds and then the game will restart with a new word.
